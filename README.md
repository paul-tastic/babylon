Congrats, you are the emporer of Babylon.

Your food requiremebnts for your kingdom is set in settings. 
Your food stores are divided into 3 types: 
    1. those that are edible now and/or will expire if not consumed. Shelf life is 1 year. Can be consumed or put in seed storage.
    2. those that are currently producing food. Must replant every 10 years. Takes 3 years to harvest after planting.
    3. those that are seeds, to be planted or otherwise consumed.

Given the conditions of the currevt year, you must decide how to balance the food storage so there is plenty to go around that year.

After each year, the next years consitions are updated from the soothsayers, and you must rebalance your supplies to feed your kingdom.
